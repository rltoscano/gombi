    <p><i>A VCS repository manager and File Browser Plug-in overlay</i></p>
    
    <p>If you use giterdone, please subscribe to the
      <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/giterdone-users/">giterdone-users</a>
      google group.</p>

    <p>This Gedit plug-in visualizes the state of the HEAD of your version-controlled
      repositories right in the File Browser side-panel-plug-in (which comes with
      Gedit by default). Emblems composited on each file or folder icon show if the
      item is staged, modified, new, or committed. Various VCS actions are easily
      accessible via the File Browser's right-click context menu: add, diff, commit,
      reset. Giterdone also comes with a Repository Manager that allows repository-level
      visualization and action. Currently, only the git and svn version control systems
      are supported.</p>

    <h1>Requirements</h1>
    <p>Giterdone requires Gedit version 2.27.5+ (Ubuntu's Karmic) for full
      functionality, but it can work with 2.27.4 without the File Browser's context
      menu support.</p>

    <p>There is a possibility in the future that Giterdone will be able to work
      with the Embedded Terminal plug-in to show the user any errors that occur
      while pushing/commiting/anything. The Embedded Terminal plug-in comes with
      the gedit-plugins (Ubuntu) package.</p>

    <p>This version of giterdone has currently only been tested in Ubuntu Lucid,
      Jaunty and Karmic.</p>
