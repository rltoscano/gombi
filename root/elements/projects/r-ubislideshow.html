    <p><i>A synchronized and distributed photo slideshow.</i></p>
    
    <p>Ubislideshow is a system that shares and receives photos to be displayed in a
      slideshow that is synchronized across all computers in a local network.
      Ubislideshow is appropriate when a physical space is occupied by several computers
      (preferably with displays, but not always) that each contain different photos. In
      this environment, configure-less daemons present on each of the computers communicate
      via a mix of UDP broadcasting and TCP streaming to make their respective photos
      available on the local network. Client programs (the actual slideshow application)
      then listen to this network traffic and download images from the daemons and
      synchronously display them. The result is a ubiquitous slideshow synchronized
      across all displays in the physical space.</p>

    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>The Ubislideshow system can be decomposed into two parts: the daemon and the
      viewer. Each is its own application and can be run separately.</p>

    <h2>Coordinator</h2>
    <p>The daemon is known as the Coordinator. The Coordinator acts as a server and
      client. When it is started on a computer, it broadcasts its presence on the local
      subnet. Concurrently, it listens for other Coordinators on the subnet. Through a
      custom protocol, the Coordinators decide on a active Coordinator which is
      responsible for controlling the synchronization across all Coordinators and
      viewers. This active Coordinator then receives lists of photos from each of the
      Coordinators and compiles a master list. This master list is then accessible by
      the viewers to find photos in the Ubislideshow system.</p>

    <h2>Viewer</h2>
    <p>The Viewer is responsible for discovering the active Coordinator and querying
      it for the current slideshow photo. It also listens for "tick" broadcasts sent
      by the active Coordinator to synchronize when to display the photo corresponding
      to the tick. The Viewer also acts as a graphical display showing each photo with
      some transition and constant effects.</p>

    <h1>Details</h1>
    <p>Ubislideshow is implemented entirely with
      <a href="http://www.qtsoftware.com/">Qt4</a> and is built using the
      <a href="http://code.google.com/p/waf/">waf</a> build system. It is compatible
      with all platforms that Qt4 supports. It is intended to be released as open source
      software under the GPL license, but is pending some minor cleanups and testing.</p>
