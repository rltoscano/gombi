            Robert Toscano has a passion for automation and loves the challenge
            that a multi-disciplinary industry like robotics presents. His masters
            thesis (completed in June 2008 at MIT) concerned the design and implementation
            of a semi-autonomous sociable robotic platform for robust interpersonal
            communication. He continued to absorb new technologies and new cultures
            through his research/development position abroad with the Music Technology
            Group at the Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona. There he contributed to the
            streaming audio processing library known as Essentia which provides
            audio/music researchers efficient, correct, and easy-to-use audio analysis
            algorithms.
